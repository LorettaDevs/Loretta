## Unreleased

## v0.2.7-beta.5
### Added
- Added support for Luau's if expression.

### Fixed
- Fixed errors not being reported for missing expressions.
- Fixed an error not being reported when a compound assignment is parsed and `AcceptCompoundAssignment` is false.
- Fixed typo in `SyntaxKind.StarEqualsToken` (was `StartEqualsToken`).
- `SyntaxNormalizer` fixes by @bmcq-0 in #37:
	- Fixed chained unary operators spacing;
	- Fixed spaces before semicolons;
	- Fixed missing space after assignment operator;
	- Fixed spaces being inserted inside parenthesis;
	- Fixed spacing inside table constructors;
	- Fixed spacing after `ìf`, `elseif`, `until` and `while`;
	- Fixed two line breaks being inserted after certain statements;
	- Fixed line breaks being inserted before semicolons;
	- Fixed line breaks being inserted twice between statements.

### Changed
- Changed the generated expression in the case of a missing expression (now it is a `IdentifierNameSyntax`
  with `IsMissing` set to `true`).
- Changed the generated statement in the case of a missing expression (now it is an `ExpressionStatementSyntax`
  with `IsMissing` set to `true` and the inner expression is the one in the bullet point above).
- Changed the generated error message in the case of a missing/invalid statement.

## v0.2.7-beta.4
### Changed
- Fixed a typo in `EmptyStatementSyntax` and its helper methods.

## v0.2.7-beta.3
### Removed
- Removed unused classes we got when vendoring Roslyn, of which, the following were public:
	- `Loretta.CodeAnalysis.SourceFileResolver`;
	- `Loretta.CodeAnalysis.AnalyzerConfig`;
	- `Loretta.CodeAnalysis.AnalyzerConfigOptionsResult`;
	- `Loretta.CodeAnalysis.AnalyzerConfigSet`;
	- `Loretta.CodeAnalysis.ErrorLogOptions`;
	- `Loretta.CodeAnalysis.SarifVersion`;
	- `Loretta.CodeAnalysis.SarifVersionFacts`.
- The following references were removed:
	- `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Analyzers`;
	- `System.Reflection.Metadata`.
- The following references were removed for the .NET Core 3.1 build:
	- `System.Collections.Immutable`;
	- `System.Memory`;
	- `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe`;
	- `System.Threading.Tasks.Extensions`.

## v0.2.7-beta.2
### Added
- Add support for implicit `self` parameter in methods.

### Fixed
- Fix parameters not having an `IVariable` associated with them.

### Changed
- Fix file-level implicit `arg` parameter being named `args`.

## v0.2.7-beta.1
### Added
- Add note about non-`CompilationUnitSyntax` rooted trees in `Script`.

### Changed
- Add validation for `default` immutable arrays of syntax trees in `Script`.
- `FileScope`s are now only generated for `CompilationUnitSyntax`es.


### Fixed
- Fix `FindScope` not returning anything for root statements.
- Fix `CompilationUnitSyntax`es not having any associated scopes.

## v0.2.6
### Added
- Add better formatting for tables when they're multiline.

### Fixed
#### Scoping
- Fix `SimpleFunctionName` handling to:
  - Not always add it as a write when it's part of a composite name.
  - Not assign the simple name variable to the entire name when it's a composite one.

#### Formatting
- Fix formatting of `:` (`a:b` was being turned into `a : b`).
- Fix multiple line breaks being inserted when formatting.
- Fix line breaks not being added after single line comments.
- Fix formatting of `[` and `]` (`a[a]` was being turned into `a [ a ]`).
- Fix empty table formatting (`{}` instead of `{ }`).
- Fix excessive spacing around parenthesis.

#### Syntax
- Fix missing `SyntaxKind`s for `UnaryExpressionSyntax` and `BinaryExpressionSyntax` in `Syntax.xml`.

## v0.2.5
### Added
- Add parameterless ctor of `Script` and `Script.Empty` for easier creation of empty scripts.
- Add support for `SimpleFunctionName` in variable handling (local vars didn't have a write added to them and a global wasn't created if a local with the same name didn't exist).
- Add `SyntaxFacts.IsOperatorToken`, `SyntaxFacts.IsUnaryOperatorToken` and `SyntaxFacts.IsBinaryOperatorToken`.
- Add `Script.FindScope`.

### Fixed
- Fix jumps to non-existent labels (labels that don't have a `::label::`) not creating a new label.
- Fix jumps to a goto label not being added to the `IGotoLabel`.

### Changed
- Configure `IFileScope`, `IFunctionScope`, `IGotoLabel`, `IScope` and `IVariable` to only allow internal implementations.
- Make `IGotoLabel.LabelSyntax` nullable to account for the case where the label has no declarations.

## v0.2.4
### Added
- Add nuget params to `Loretta.CodeAnalysis`, `Loretta.CodeAnalysis.Lua` and `Loretta.CodeAnalysis.Lua.Experimental`;
- Add CD flow to publish packages to a public **myget.org** (not nuget.org) feed.
- Implement `ConstantFolder`;

### Changed
- [Breaking] Changed what is accepted as whitespace to not be unicode-aware (as lua isn't);

### Fixed
- Fix `SyntaxNormalizer` adding a space after `.`s;

## v0.2.3:
### Fixed
- Updated `Syntax.xml` to include `BangToken` in `UnaryExpressionSyntax` and `BangEqualsToken` in `BinaryExpressionSyntax`;
- Fixed infinite loop in `LuaSyntaxWalker` with empty `StatementList`s;

### Added
- Implemented `\z` whitespace voider escape for short strings;
- Implemented `SourceTextReader` as an attempt to reduce allocations when lexing;

### Changed
- Removed GParse dependency (side effect of `SourceTextReader`).

## v0.2.2
### Changed
- [Breaking] Only store `IScope`s that directly reference a `IVariable` in the `IVariable.ReferencingScopes`;
- [Breaking] Move `CapturedVariables` to `IFunctionScope` as it is not applicable to non-function scopes;
- Updated the README with instructions and documentation on v0.2.

### Added
- Add `ReferencedVariables` to `IScope` with all `IVariable`s referenced by the scope and its children;

## v0.2.1
### Added
- [Breaking] Implement 5.3 bitwise operators along with `LuaSyntaxOptions` setting for erroring on them;

  Breaking change: the precedences for each operator were altered.
- Implement a warning about `\n\r` being used as it is recognized as a single line break by Lua;

### Changed
- Amortize allocations made by string parsing.
